Description:

This game is a simple memory game with vivid colors and addicting gameplay. The user has to select the colored dots in the order that they appear on the screen within a given time limit. The game starts out with just one dot appearing, but the number of dots quickly rises as the user successfully select the dots in the correct order. Points are giving for correctly identifying a set of dots and the user will move up a level once they reach a 10 dot combo! All of this with the addition of the increasing speed of which the dots appear will make gameplay both quick and challenging.

On the rainbow painted streets of Dotville, the angry homophobic dragon “Trump Firebreather” has captured the beautiful Drag Queen Princess, 1010. The only way to free 1010 is to hack the code while the dragon is getting his hair plug "replugged." Match 3 or more combos of color to level up. Link colors at the top, sides, bottom or even diagonally. Only "touching" colors form a combo. The greater the combo the faster you level up. The lock is a 10 phase lock. Reach level 10 and free 1010. Hurry! Time is running out!
